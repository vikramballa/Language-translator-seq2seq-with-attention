Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog's ear

Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog's ear

Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key

Never blow in a dog's ear

Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog's ear

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of ISO9660 standard which is supported by most of the operating systems including Linux and all versions of Windows ©. However MacOS X cannot read images created with version 3 of ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it; but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. NOTE: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on linux.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows ©. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it; but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.

The project is too large for the disc even with the overburn option.
The project is too large for the disc and you must remove files from it. You may want to use this option if you're using 90 or 100 min CD-R(W) which cannot be properly recognized and therefore needs the overburn option. Note: This option might cause failure.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows™. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows™. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows-compatible?

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows™. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones).

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.
Ne_ver Add Such File
Al_ways Add Such File
Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows™. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows-compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

The data size is too large for the disc even with the overburn option.
_Burn Several Discs
Burn the selection of files across several media
Please choose another CD or DVD or insert a new one.
No track information (artist, title, ...) will be written to the disc.
This is not supported by the current active burning backend.
Please add files.
There are no files to write to disc
Please add songs.

Please select another image.
It doesn't appear to be a valid disc image or a valid cue file.
Please insert a disc that is not copy protected.
All required applications and libraries are not installed.
Please replace the disc with a supported CD or DVD.
Would you like to burn beyond the disc's reported capacity?
The data size is too large for the disc and you must remove files from the selection otherwise. You may want to use this option if you're using 90 or 100 min CD-R(W) which cannot be properly recognised and therefore need overburn option. NOTE: This option might cause failure.
_Overburn
Burn beyond the disc's reported capacity
The drive that holds the source disc will also be the one used to record.
A new writable disc will be required once the currently loaded one has been copied.

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.
Ne_ver Add Such File
Al_ways Add Such File
Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows™. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows-compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Enable H.245 tunneling
This enables H.245 Tunneling mode. In H.245 Tunneling mode H.245 messages are encapsulated into the H.225 channel (port 1720). This saves one TCP connection during calls. H.245 Tunneling was introduced in H.323v2 and Netmeeting does not support it. Using both Fast Start and H.245 Tunneling can crash some versions of Netmeeting.
Enable early H.245
This enables H.245 early in the setup

This is the Ekiga general configuration assistant. The following steps will set up Ekiga by asking a few simple questions. Once you have completed these steps, you can always change them later by selecting Preferences in the Edit menu.
Welcome to Ekiga
Personal Information
Please enter your first name and your surname:
Your first name and surname will be used when connecting to other VoIP and videoconferencing software.
If you do not have a SIP or H323 account, ekiga can only be used on your local internal network (inside your company, for example). You will require an account if you want to be accessible to people on the Internet. Many web sites allow you to create an account. We suggest that you use a free ekiga.net account, which allows you to be joined by any person with a SIP account. If you want to call regular phone lines too, we suggest that you purchase an inexpensive call out account. The following two pages allow you to create such accounts.
Introduction to Accounts
Ekiga.net Account
Please enter your username:
Please enter your password:
The username and password are used to login to your existing account at the ekiga.net free SIP service. If you do not have an ekiga.net SIP address yet, you may first create an account below. This will provide a SIP address that allows people to call you. You may skip this step if you use an alternative SIP service, or if you would prefer to specify the login details later.
I do not want to sign up for the ekiga.net free service
Ekiga Call Out Account
Please enter your account ID:
Please enter your PIN code:
You can make calls to regular phones and cell numbers worldwide using Ekiga. To enable this, you need to do two things: - First buy an account at the URL below. - Then enter your account ID and PIN code. The service will work only if your account is created using the URL in this dialog.
I do not want to sign up for the Ekiga Call Out service

This is the Ekiga general configuration assistant. The following steps will set up Ekiga by asking a few simple questions. Once you have completed these steps, you can always change them later by selecting Preferences in the Edit menu.
Welcome to Ekiga
Please enter your first name and your surname:
Your first name and surname will be used when connecting to other VoIP and videoconferencing software.
If you do not have a SIP or H323 account, ekiga can only be used on your local internal network (inside your company, for example). You will require an account if you want to be accessible to people on the Internet. Many web sites allow you to create an account. We suggest that you use a free ekiga.net account, which allows you to be joined by any person with a SIP account. If you want to call regular phone lines too, we suggest that you purchase an inexpensive call out account. The following two pages allow you to create such accounts.
Introduction to Accounts
Ekiga.net Account
Please enter your username:
Please enter your password:
The username and password are used to login to your existing account at the ekiga.net free SIP service. If you do not have an ekiga.net SIP address yet, you may first create an account below. This will provide a SIP address that allows people to call you. You may skip this step if you use an alternative SIP service, or if you would prefer to specify the login details later.
I do not want to sign up for the ekiga.net free service
Ekiga Call Out Account
Please enter your account ID:
Please enter your PIN code:
You can make calls to regular phones and cell numbers worldwide using Ekiga. To enable this, you need to do two things: - First buy an account at the URL below. - Then enter your account ID and PIN code. The service will work only if your account is created using the URL in this dialog.
I do not want to sign up for the Ekiga Call Out service
Connection Type
Please choose your connection type:
56k Modem
ISDN
DSL/Cable (128 kbit/s uplink)
DSL/Cable (512 kbit/s uplink)
LAN
Keep current settings
The connection type will permit determining the best quality settings that Ekiga will use during calls. You can later change the settings individually in the preferences window.
Please choose the audio ringing device:
The audio ringing device is the device that will be used to play the ringing sound on incoming calls.
Please choose the audio output device:
The audio output device is the device that will be used to play audio during calls.
Please choose the audio input device:
The audio input device is the device that will be used to record your voice during calls.
Video Input Device
Please choose your video input device:
The video input device is the device that will be used to capture video during calls.
Configuration Complete
You have now finished the Ekiga configuration. All the settings can be changed in the Ekiga preferences. Enjoy!

Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out or not. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in or not. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK_PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is choosen, then the trans_color key determines the used color value.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming or not.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether or not the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show/hide the window toolbar.
Show/hide the window statusbar.
Show/hide the image collection pane.
Image collection pane position. Set to 0 for bottom; 1 for left; 2 for top; 3 for right.
Whether the image collection pane should be resizable or not.

Show/hide the image collection pane scroll buttons.
Trash images without asking
If activated Eye of GNOME wont ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the filechooser should show the user's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the filechooser will display the user's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e.g. as used by netbooks. If disabled the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.

Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
Use a custom background color
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK_PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is chosen, then the trans-color key determines the color value used.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show/Hide the window toolbar.
Show/Hide the window statusbar.
Show/Hide the image collection pane.
Image collection pane position. Set to 0 for bottom; 1 for left; 2 for top; 3 for right.
Whether the image collection pane should be resizable.
Show/Hide the window side pane.
Show/Hide the image collection pane scroll buttons.
Trash images without asking
If activated, Eye of GNOME won't ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the file chooser should show the user's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the file chooser will display the user's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up, it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated, the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e.g. as used by netbooks. If disabled, the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.

Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
The color that is used to fill the area behind the image. If the use-background-color key is not set, the color is determined by the active GTK+ theme instead.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK_PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is chosen, then the trans-color key determines the color value used.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Use a custom background color
If this is active, the color set by the background-color key will be used to fill the area behind the image. If it is not set, the current GTK+ theme will determine the fill color.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show/Hide the window toolbar.
Show/Hide the window statusbar.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane.
Image gallery pane position. Set to 0 for bottom; 1 for left; 2 for top; 3 for right.
Whether the image gallery pane should be resizable.
Show/Hide the window side pane.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane scroll buttons.
Close main window without asking to save changes.
Trash images without asking
If activated, Eye of GNOME won't ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the file chooser should show the user's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the file chooser will display the user's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up, it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated, the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e.g. as used by netbooks. If disabled, the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.
External program to use for editing images

Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
The color that is used to fill the area behind the image. If the use-background-color key is not set, the color is determined by the active GTK+ theme instead.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK_PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is chosen, then the trans-color key determines the color value used.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Use a custom background color
If this is active, the color set by the background-color key will be used to fill the area behind the image. If it is not set, the current GTK+ theme will determine the fill color.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show/Hide the window toolbar.
Show/Hide the window statusbar.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane.
Image gallery pane position. Set to 0 for bottom; 1 for left; 2 for top; 3 for right.
Whether the image gallery pane should be resizable.
Show/Hide the window side pane.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane scroll buttons.
Close main window without asking to save changes.
Trash images without asking
If activated, Eye of GNOME won't ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the file chooser should show the user's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the file chooser will display the user's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up, it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated, the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e.g. as used by netbooks. If disabled, the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.
External program to use for editing images
The desktop file name (including the ".desktop") of the application to use for editing images (when the "Edit Image" toolbar button is clicked). Set to the empty string to disable this feature.

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

This is the port on the LDAP server that Evolution will try to connect to. A list of standard ports has been provided. Ask your system administrator what port you should specify.
This is the method Evolution will use to authenticate you. Note that setting this to "Email Address" requires anonymous access to your LDAP server.
The search scope defines how deep you would like the search to extend down the directory tree. A search scope of "sub" will include all entries below your search base. A search scope of "one" will only include the entries one level beneath your base.

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Selecting this option means that Evolution will only connect to your LDAP server if your LDAP server supports SSL.
Selecting this option means that Evolution will only connect to your LDAP server if your LDAP server supports TLS.
Selecting this option means that your server does not support either SSL or TLS. This means that your connection will be insecure, and that you will be vulnerable to security exploits.

This is the port on the LDAP server that Evolution will try to connect to. A list of standard ports has been provided. Ask your system administrator what port you should specify.
This is the method Evolution will use to authenticate you. Note that setting this to "Email Address" requires anonymous access to your LDAP server.
The search scope defines how deep you would like the search to extend down the directory tree. A search scope of "sub" will include all entries below your search base. A search scope of "one" will only include the entries one level beneath your base.

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Encode filenames in an Outlook/GMail way

Some mailing lists set a Reply-To: header to trick users into sending replies to the list, even when they ask Evolution to make a private reply. Setting this option to TRUE will attempt to ignore such Reply-To: headers, so that Evolution will do as you ask it.

It works by comparing the Reply-To: header with a List-Post: header, if there is one.

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Fetching Feeds (%d enabled)
Evolution RSS Reader Plugin. This plugin adds RSS Feeds support for Evolution mail. RSS support was built upon the somewhat existing RSS support in evolution-1.4 branch. The motivation behind this was to have RSS in same place as mails, at this moment I do not see the point in having a separate RSS reader since a RSS Article is like an email message. Evolution RSS can display article using summary view or HTML view. HTML can be displayed using the following engines: gtkHTML, Apple's Webkit or Firefox/Gecko. Version: evolution-rss +VERSION+ +URL+

Calculates the periodic interest necessary to increase an investment to a future value, over the number of compounding periods.
Straight-Line Depreciation
_Cost:
_Salvage:
Calculates the straight-line depreciation of an asset for one period. The straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable cost evenly over the useful life of an asset. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits Depreciation
Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits method. This method of depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Payment Period

GCompris Administration Menu
Left-Click with the mouse to select an activity
If you want to fine tune GCompris to your needs, you can use the administration module here. The ultimate goal is to provide child-specific reporting for parents and teacher who want to monitor the progress, strengths and needs of their children.
- In the 'Boards' section you can change the list of activities. Just untoggle them in the treeview. You can change the language used for reading, for example, then the language used for saying the names of colors. - You can save multiple configurations, and switch between them easily. In the 'Profile' section add a profile, then in the 'Board' section select the profile in the combobox, then select the boards you want to be active. You can add multiple profiles, with different lists of boards, and different languages. You set the default profile in the 'Profile' section, by choosing the profile you want, then clicking on the 'Default' button. You can also choose a profile from the command line. - You can add users, classes and for each class, you can create groups of users. Note that you can import users from a comma-separated file. Assign one or more groups to a profile, after which those new logins will appear after restarting GCompris. Being able to identify individual children in GCompris means we can provide individual reports. It also recognizes the children as individuals; they can learn to type in and recognize their own usernames (login is configurable).

In this game, children can draw freely. The goal is to discover how to create attractive drawings based on basic shapes: rectangles, ellipses and lines. To give children a wider range of choices, a set of images can also be used.
Select a drawing tool on the left, and a color down the bottom. Then click and drag in the white area to create a new shape. Once you've completed a drawing, you can select a new frame to work on by selecting one of the small rectangles on the bottom. Each frame contains the same content as its previous one. You can then edit it by moving objects a little bit or adding/deleting objects. When you create several frames and then click on the 'film' button, you will see all your images in a continuous slide-show (an infinite loop pattern). You can change the last image in your film by right clicking on a time frame. You can also change the viewing speed in this mode. In viewing mode, click on the 'drawing' button to return to drawing mode. You can also save and reload your animations with the 'floppy disk' and 'folder' buttons.

Oware
Play the Oware strategy game against Tux
The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to accomplish this. Since there are an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24. The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or both players have taken 24 seeds each (draw). If both players agree that the game has been reduced to an endless cycle, each player captures the seeds on their side of the board.
At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owaregt;)

Factor Number Munchers
Guide the Number Muncher to all the factors of the number at the top of the screen.
Learn about factors and multiples.
The factors of a number are all the numbers that divide that number evenly. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 4 is not a factor of 6 because 6 cannot be divided into 4 equal pieces. If one number is a multiple of a second number, then the second number is a factor of the first number. You can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people in those families. So 1, 2, 3 and 6 all fit into the 6 family, but 4 belongs to another family. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number.
Inequality Number Munchers
Guide the Number Muncher to the all the expressions that do not equal the number at the top of the screen.
Practice addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Multiple Number Munchers
Guide the Number Muncher to all the multiples of the number at the top of the screen.
Learn about multiples and factors.
The multiples of a number are all the numbers that are equal to the original number times another number. For example, 24, 36, 48 and 60 are all multiples of 12. 25 is not a multiple of 12 because there isn't any number that can be multiplied by 12 to get 25. If one number is a factor of a second number, then the second number is a multiple of the first number. Again, you can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people who belong to those families. The factor 5, has parents 10, grandparents 15, great-grandparents 20, great-great-grandparents 25, and every extra step of 5 is another great- in front! But the number 5 does not belong in the 8 or 23 families. You can't fit any number of 5s into 8 or 23 with nothing left over. So '8 isn't a multiple of 5, nor is 23. Only 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ... are multiples (or families or steps) of 5. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number.
Prime Number Munchers
Guide the Number Muncher to all the prime numbers.
Learn about prime numbers
Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1. For example, 3 is a prime number, but 4 isn't (because 4 is divisible by 2). You can think of prime numbers as very small families: they only ever have two people in them! Only themselves and 1. You can't fit any other numbers into them with nothing left over. 5 is one of these lonely numbers (only 5 × 1 = 5), but you can see that 6 has 2 and 3 in its family as well (6 × 1 = 6, 2 × 3 = 6). So 6 is not a prime number. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number.

Move the entire stack to the right peg, one disc at a time
The Tower of Hanoi
Reproduce the tower on the right side
The object of the game is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying the following rules: * only one disc may be moved at a time * no disc may be placed atop a smaller disc
Drag and Drop the top pieces only from one peg to another, to reproduce the tower on the right in the empty space on the left.
The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. There is a legend about a Hindu temple whose priests were constantly engaged in moving a set of 64 discs according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. According to the legend, the world would end when the priests finished their work. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle. It is not clear whether Lucas invented this legend or was inspired by it. (source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_hanoigt;)

Memory Game with images
Flip the cards to find the matching pairs
Train your memory and remove all the cards
A set of blank cards is shown. Each card has a picture on the other side, and each picture card has a twin exactly the same. Click on a card to see its hidden picture, and try to match the twins. You can only turn over two cards at once, so you need to remember where a picture is, while you look for its twin. When you turn over the twins, they both disappear.
Addition memory game
Turn the cards over to find two numbers which add up the same, until all the cards are gone.
Practise adding up, until all the cards are gone.
You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding an adding-up sum, or the answer to the sum. An adding-up sum looks like this: 2 + 2 = 4 The numbers on one side of the equals sign (=) have to be the same as the number on the other side. So 2 (1, 2) and 2 more (3, 4) makes 4. Count aloud when you work this out, and count on your fingers, because the more ways you do something, the better you remember it. You can also use blocks, or buttons, or anything you can count. If you have lots of brothers and sisters, you can count them! Or the kids in your class at school. Sing counting songs. Count lots of things, for practice, and you'll be very good at adding-up! In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of an adding-up sum (also called an addition sum). You need to find the two parts of the sum, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole sum. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper sum. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the sums, you've won the game! :)
Addition and subtraction memory game
Turn the cards over to find two numbers which add or subtract the same, until all the cards are gone.
Addition and subtraction
Practise addition, subtraction, until all the cards are gone.
You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding an operation, or the answer to it. In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of an operation. You need to find the two parts of the operation, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole operation. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper equality. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the operations, you've won the game! :)

Turn the cards over to find two numbers which subtract the same, until all the cards are gone.
Practise subtraction, until all the cards are gone.
You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding a subtraction, or the answer to it. A subtraction looks like this: 3 - 1 = 2 The numbers on one side of the equals sign (=) have to be the same as the number on the other side. So 3 (1, 2, 3) less 1 (1) makes 2. Count aloud when you work this out, and count on your fingers, because the more ways you do something, the better you remember it. You can also use blocks, or buttons, or anything you can count. If you have lots of brothers and sisters, you can count them! Or the kids in your class at school. Sing counting songs. Count lots of things, for practice, and you'll be very good at subtracting numbers! In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of a subtraction. You need to find the two parts of the subtraction, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole difference. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper difference. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the subtracts, you've won the game! :)

Sea race (Single Player)
Give good instructions to your ship in order to be first in the race.
In this activity, you will learn how to enter commands into a computer. Even if the language is extremely basic, you learn here how to think ahead and construct a program. This activity can be used to introduce the programming concept to children.
In the text entry, enter one command per line, to control your boat. Commands supported are displayed between the two entry areas. The 'left' and 'right' commands must be followed by an angle in degrees. The angle value is also called a 'parameter' to the left or right command. By default 45 degrees is used. The 'forward' command accepts a distance parameter. By default 1 is used. For example: - left 90: Make a perpendicular left turn - forward 10: Go forward for 10 units (as displayed on the ruler). The goal is to reach the right of the screen (the red line). When done, you can try to improve your program and start a new race with the same weather conditions by using the retry button. You can click and drag your mouse anywhere on the map to get a measurement in distance and angle. Going to the next level will give you more complex weather conditions.

Sudoku, place unique symbols in a square.
Symbols must be unique in a row, in a column, and (if defined) each region.
Completing the puzzle requires patience and logical ability
The aim of the puzzle is to enter a symbol or numeral from 1 through 9 in each cell of a grid, most frequently a 9x9 grid made up of 3x3 subgrids (called 'regions'), starting with various symbols or numerals given in some cells (the 'givens'). Each row, column and region must contain only one instance of each symbol or numeral (Source &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudokugt;).
For the first level with colored symbols, select a symbol on the left and click on its target position. For the higher levels, click on an empty square to give it the keyboard focus. Then enter a possible letter or number. GCompris will not let you enter invalid data.

The tangram puzzle game
The objective is to form a given shape with seven pieces
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tangram (Chinese: literally "seven boards of cunning") is a Chinese puzzle. While the tangram is often said to be ancient, its existence has only been verified as far back as 1800. It consists of 7 pieces, called tans, which fit together to form a square; taking the square as the unit: \t* 5 right isosceles triangles \t\to 2 small (legs of 1) \t\to 1 medium size (legs of square root of 2) \t\to 2 large size (legs of 2) \t* 1 square (side of 1) \t* 1 parallelogram (sides of 1 and square root of 2)
Select the tangram to form. Move a piece by dragging it. Right-click on it to create a symmetrical item. Select an item and drag around it to show the rotation you want. Once you've shown what shape you want, the computer will create it. If you need help, click on the shape button, and the border of the shape will be drawn.
The original code was written by Philippe Banwarth in 1999. It was ported to GCompris by Yves Combe in 2005.

The '/' name can only be a directory, not a key
Value for `%s' set in a read-only source at the front of your configuration path
Unable to store a value at key '%s', as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file %s/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered. There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf
